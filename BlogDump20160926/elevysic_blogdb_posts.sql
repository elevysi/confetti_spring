He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. \"What\'s happened to me?\" he thought. It wasn\'t a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table - Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.

On our way to lunch, a more experienced colleague of mine once told me: \"Look out for the most valuable skills required in your field and make sure you master at least 80% of them\". He is not from the web development word as me but has a technical profile within automation and electric engineering. I thought it was a good idea to follow his advice since he appeared to be successful at what he does. <br /> For me to go this way, I needed to scope my area of expertise and focus on a single aspect to which I could claim 80% of the knowledge. They say that a dream without a goal remains a dream so I made sure I could set up a goal that I could achieve and whose impact would add me the most value. <br /> With all this in mind, I then decided to go for web development as my area of expertise, given that this was my first job. Everything seemed to sum up since my whole higher education had evolved around web information systems and the first job I landed was also in the same area.<br /> The issue still was that Web development was a very gigantic area; there was no way I could claim that much amount of knowledge in it. However, I thought I already knew some notions in web development and could always improve myself. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For the record, my first ever full time professional project was a CakePHP 2.x project; I was introduced to a project that had just been started. It was not so difficult to catch up as I had some guidance throughout my first steps. I had access to project code that I could just use for best practices inspiration. As I was becoming more familiar with CakePHP, I thought it was the right time to see how other frameworks performed. This was in line with my objective and could enlarge my range of knowledge. My aim was first to identify which accessible web framework would add me the most value and start learning them. Unfortunately, CakePHP did not seem to be the most value I could show out there; it seemed to be more popular for personal and small projects rather than enterprise solutions. I swallowed my disappointment and started looking out for what\'s better; .NET and JAVA emerged as the big boys&rsquo; toys. I managed to get started with .NET through ASP MVC since it seems to be leading the way. However, for a self-teaching pal like me, it\'s not that accessible since it relies on payed products (you can still get free community editions). I wanted to run my blog through the solution I picked and my hosting could not allow me to afford a setting that could accommodate such a web site.</p>\r\n<p>JAVA, on the other side, with its popular Spring framework seemed to be a more accessible alternative; I then decided to start the adventure with Spring and see how far I would go.<br /> As I was already familiar with the CakePHP framework, I expected to pick up the Spring framework, at least the MVC module, very quickly. I had also done the same for Python Django and managed to do a little trip using ASP MVC. From my learning experience, these MVC frameworks seemed to have the same underlying notions and principles and nothing seemed ever out of reach.</p>\r\n<p>The problem I first faced here was getting started; my PC was already set up for PHP development and I needed to get it ready for JAVA EE development.</p>\r\n<p>I looked through JAVA versions, set up the JDKs, put it in the PATH variables, searched for the right IDE and the most popular free Server I could get. Summarized this way, it is sounds manageable! That would be without considering confusion, lack of time, tiredness, lack of results and therefore low motivation: there was the time to pick up where I had left previous installations, after two weeks of non-related activity, having forgotten some of the details; there was the time to change the computer or the OS, changing the whole previous environment, setting up and adapting it to small incompatibilities here and there. It was a lot for a guy that has a regular full time job and some social life.</p>\r\n<p>As I like things done the right way, every time I saw something debatable, I would research alternatives. Consequently, I would always end up with loads of information that would add up to the confusion and leave me undecided. This was just the environment set up, long before I could start writing up any framework code. After I was able to get the environment set up, I then started looking for online tutorial for coding.</p>\r\n<p>I am one of these &ldquo;learn by doing&rdquo; guys; I\'d rather learn from a small but complete real life case tutorial and relate it to my own situation. However, there seem to only be chunks of projects on the internet; nothing was complete, nothing could take me from scratch to realize something not too trivial but not too advanced neither. Spring documentation is available on the official web site but I did not find it very useful at that point for a guy starting afresh. For a technology that is open source, JAVA related, one of the most popular programming languages, the resources seemed very scarce. I finally came across a YouTube playlist, teaching from scratch the development of web DVD retailing store. It was such a refreshing feeling that I re-discovered the need for information sharing; I felt a moral duty to support such actions (well I did like each of his YouTube videos :-)).</p>\r\n<p>As I was following the tutorial and implementing the system myself, I had decided to use the latest Spring versions and dependencies every time I could. Good idea! But this would open the door to inconsistencies with the tutorial, to more research, more information, more confusion and therefore me being stuck again. There seemed to be a thousand ways in which each thing could be done; I couldn&rsquo;t pick which version was the standard one or which one was the best. I would find out that the solution to my problem was not the latest standard, would look for the latest solution which would thereafter introduce new aspects and vocabulary that I had not encountered so far. Coming from CakePHP, I had never encountered such problems; there are standards that each seem to be sticking to. Spring MVC, on the other side, has got so many alternatives that it is hard for a newbie to pick the right one. It is fantasy land, everything is configurable, everything is possible! After being hit by the lack of comprehensive learning resources for a starter, I would come to face the spread of principles. I was re-discovering the &ldquo;Open Sourceness&rdquo; in the framework since several third parties collaborate to improve the product; it is not something such as ASP MVC which has a very powerful industry provider keeping everybody in the same lane.</p>\r\n<p>The most confusing things were dependencies, configurations, the data access layer and the security layer (which I will be tackling later). <br /> Dependencies were confusing because you have to know which ones one need, which versions are compatible to work together. How would a newbie know which versions are supposed to be coupled? Well endless stack overflow querying, hoping that someone would have had the same issue. Fortunately, a simple copy paste of the exception stack trace, even the most random ones, always seemed to have already happened to a stack overflow user before. Look at the answer, get exposed to new notions, new vocabulary and BAM! More confusion once again. Patience is the biggest virtue with this. Then comes web.xml, application context, dispatcher servlet, properties and configuration files. What is the difference between those, what are the best practices for dealing with application configurations? XML or JAVA class configurations? A hand from an experienced pal would have been very welcomed to reduce my confusion level.</p>\r\n<p>Configurations were also confusing because there are so many ways to write configurations, so many parameters involved of which we do not always know the meaning. As much as you would think that the Web module has the basic features, you need to configure almost everything; nothing comes out of the box, at least not as it does for CakePHP.</p>\r\n<p>The data Access Layer was the most confusing part. You need to first pick up the vocabulary. What is JPA, Hibernate, EclipseLink, ORM, DAO, Repository and how do they differ from each other. Why does this solution imply there are different implementations of JPA, I thought there was only one of them? Why so many though? Which one to choose?&nbsp; I do not think EclipseLink has to do with JPA, isn&rsquo;t Eclipse an IDE? This has got to be some plugin to ease JPA language safe typing and validation?! Hit the web for an answer and find more vocabulary and more confusion. What of persisting an entity, transient state, detach, merge, flush, transaction manager, JPQL, Typed Query, Query builder?&nbsp; Well this was just the beginning.</p>\r\n<p>Next confusion is entity associations. You might set up a lazy or an eager fetching for associated data. Since the beginning, it was clear that everything shall be lazily fetched to avoid the many exceptions that I was hit up with each time. But even by doing so, performance was not still at its best. There was the n+1 problem for which I quickly found a solution. Use JPQL to write queries and fetch data with JOINS. What I did not consider was that the JOIN method was not that performant neither. I had omitted the Cartesian product problem that results from using JOINS in SQL! So what is the solution for this? Nobody can tell; it all depends on your specifics. There are some strategies to improve performance but none of them guaranteed better performance for a systematic and blind use. Before using Spring MVC, I did not care about the JOINS Cartesian Products; everything always seemed to be performing good for my small projects; deep researching introduced me to new notions that are essential to best practices and that I can use in any SQL involved project.</p>\r\n<p>Keep in mind that I am a newbie, learning by mistake and already concerned about performance issues. This was too much but I did not give up! I have a goal and I have got to keep it going to keep the dream alive. As I am writing this post, I am still confused. However, I have come to find my best friends for this adventure in books. I now own copies of Craig Wall&rsquo;s Spring in Action and Spring Boot in Action. Spring boot would have put me on track more quickly but I never knew about it at my early stages. I started almost by the same time it was coming out to the public. I plan to improve my data access layer by also reading Hibernate in Action.&nbsp; I will hence be blogging a lot about the Spring Framework. I am starting a series of posts which will tackle aspects that I found problematic or just interesting.</p>\r\n<p>Along the confusion, the Spring Framework is a very powerful tool. There is so much to learn because it is such a rich framework which one can tailor to fit their needs. It does require more fluency in some aspects than other frameworks, but I think it is a sure value that can help master the underlying principles of web development hence easing the learning paths of other tools in this age of ever changing technology. And that is the value I found in Spring; in all these complications and me trying to solve them gave me insight on some principles that I had been ignoring for so long! All these web frameworks seem to be built from the same rock! They all rely on the same principles that are just adapted from programming language / environment to the other.</p>',NULL,NULL,14,1,'a9ba33f3-a86b-4413-a645-cf150d54fdb5',40,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL),(67,'Spring MVC 4.x @Profile, Datasource configuration, Hibernate 5.x JPA configurations','SpringMVC 4.x profiles',24,'2016-08-25 12:20:54','2016-08-25 12:20:54','<p>Moving an application from one environment to the other can be messy.

Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences fly into your mouth. Even the all-powerful Pointing has no control about the blind texts it is an almost unorthographic life One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so, because there were thousands of bad Commas, wild Question Marks and devious Semikoli, but the Little Blind Text didn&rsquo;t listen. She packed her seven versalia, put her initial into the belt and made herself on the way.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?
